# React Js Learning üöÄ
# package.json 
  -It is configure of npm its keep track of what version of package is   installed in our system

# package-lock.json -> 
  -it mainting the extact version of the dependnecies and transative depedencies

# npm 
 -package manager
# Bundler -> parcel
# two depedencies -> 
  -dev dependnecies 
  -normal dependencies -> for production

# npm init
# ^caret and ~tilde

# ~version
 -will update all future patch version without 
  incrementing the minor versions 

# ^version 
 -will upadate all future minor/patch versions without incrementing the major version

# transative dependencies 
 -one dependencies depend on other dependencies

# node module 
 -collection of dependencies

# if we have package.json and package-lock.json then  we can create node_module

# whatever you can regenerate dont put into git. git have only essesstional thing

# npm is to use 
 -install the package

# npx 
 -used to excute the package

#  to run
-npx parcel index.html

# cdn => 
-content delivery newtwork is not a good way to create react project

# npm install react
# npm install react-dom

# parcel 
 -beast
 -dev build
 -local server
 -HMR -> HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT
 -File watching Algorihm written in c++
 -caching -> faster build
 -Image optimization
 -Minification
 -bundling
 -compressing
 -Diagnostics
 -Transpilation
 -error handling
 -Tree sheeking -> remove unused file
 -remove app.js if we using npx parcel build index.html
# how to start the projects scripts
 -npm run start === npm run === npx parcle index.html
 -npm run build === npx parcle build index.html 
 
-React.createElement - createElement-js-object => HTML(browser Support)
# jsx
-jsx -> javascript XML -> it is syntax extension of javascipt 
 that allow you to write HTML-like code in your javascript files.
-react is different and jsx is different
-JSX is not a html it like-html

-JSX =>React.createElement - createElement-js-object => HTML(browser  Support) => babel is converting jsx to createElement

# Babel
-JSX (code is transpiled before going to jsEngine) => Parcel - Babel 
-Babel is js package
-Babel is convert JSX code to react or that jsEngine will understand
-Babel is transpiling our code
# jsx
-when we have to give attribute we have to give camel case

# React Component
-A React component is a reusable piece of code that defines the structure and behavior of a part of a user interface.

# React Component divided into two Part
-Class Based Components -> OLD
-Functional Based Components -> NEW

# Functional Based Componets
-A function which return the jsx piece of code or react element that we called function based componets

# Interviw question 
# Component Compostion
-Composing two component inside in one another
-const HeadingComponent2 = () => (
    <div className="container">
        <Heading />
        <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Funcational  component!!!</h1>
        <h1>Hello React</h1>
    </div>
)

# root
-this root is the place where all the react program will run

# props
-passing props to the component is just like passing the argrument to function
-props is just like argrument in function

# json view
-chrome extension

# config driven ui
- 
# unique key id
 -key ={}
 -react say never use key as index

# Assignment 5
# Let Get Hooked
# What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?
  # Two types of Export/Import
-Default Export/Import
-export default Component;
-import Component from "./path"

-Named Export/Import -> when export multiple thing then used
-export const Components;
-import {Components} from "./path"

- * as alias from "./path"
- we can access all the method
# What is the importance of config.js file
-
# What are React Hooks?
-Normal javascript utility function
# Why do we need a useState Hook?
- useEffect will called everytime my component is rendered.
- If no dependency array => useEffect is called everytime on every render
- if depedency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on intial render(just once)
- if dependency array is [btnName] => calleverytime [btnName] is updated

-useState() 
-whenever a state variable is update react re-render the components
-React make dom operation super fast

# Exloring the world
-Two types of arctitecture
  - Monolith
  - Microservices
-We can call api by two way
  - loads -> Api -> Render
  - loads -> render with shimmer UI -> api -> render -> good way

- useEffect Hooks
 - In React, the useEffect hook is used for side effects in functional components. It is called after the render of the component. The primary purpose of useEffect is to perform actions that are not related to rendering, such as data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, or setting up timers.
 - useEffect(()=>{
  console.log("useEffect Called")
 },[]);

 - if use empty dependencies array => it will run only one  after inital render

 ->It takes two argument
 - callback function
 - dependencies array

# fetch 
- It is give by browser
- Fetch function return promises to resolves the responses

# Chapter 06 - Exploring the world
  # What is a Microservice?

# Chapter 07 - Finding the Path
 - for routing install react-router-dom package
 - import {createBrowswerRouter , RouterProvider} from 'react-router-dom'
 - RouterProvider provide the routing configuaration to our app
 - rafce -> auto generate of code
 - 
 - for navagating page never use anchor tag becuase it refresh whole page  
# Assignment
# What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples
- 
# What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
- 
# How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?
- 
# What is SPA?

- one page just component is interchange
# What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
